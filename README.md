# Telegram Groups Indexer Bot

## About the project

The "Telegram Groups Indexer Bot" ([TGroupsIndexerBot](https://github.com/matypist/tgroupsindexerbot)) project was born out of the need, in its time by the "Sapienza Students" organization, and today by the [Sapienza Students Network](https://github.com/sapienzastudentsnetwork/sapienzastudentsnetwork.github.io) organization, to promote and make the Telegram groups of students of different courses and their different subjects more easily discoverable from other prospective students.

### Demo

A live demo of the "Telegram Groups Indexer Bot" is available for you to try out. You can access it directly through this [link to @SapienzaStudentsBot](https://telegram.me/SapienzaStudentsBot), where you can explore the various features of the bot and see how it helps prospective students discover and join Telegram groups related to their courses and subjects at the university. The bot provides an easy-to-use interface, allowing users to quickly search for relevant groups based on their field of study, course, or subject, making the process of connecting with other students more efficient and streamlined.

### Current project status

This first version lays the foundations for indexing in particular with regard to the listing of indexed groups to bot users, but there is still a long way to go, since the main functionality, which consists of the bot's users being able to add the bot to a group and autonomously make the group indexed by choosing a category (e.g. a degree course) and a sub-category, is still to be implemented.

   b. Downloading it as ZIP [[Mirror]](https://github.com/matypist/tgroupsindexerbot/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and extracting it in a directory

3. Verify that python3 and python3-pip are correctly installed and functioning by running the `python3 -V` and `pip3 -V` commands respectively

4. Open a terminal window or command prompt window and go to the local project root directory using the `cd` command followed by the directory path (e.g. `cd "C:\Users\matypist\Downloads\tgroupsindexerbot"`)

5. Run the `pip install pipenv` command to install pipenv, a tool required to create and manage a virtual environment containing this project's dependencies and environment variables 

6. Run the `pipenv install` command to install all the dependencies required for this project _(which, should you be interested, are specified in this project's Pipfile)_

7. Create a file named `.env` on the local project root directory, with the two following lines:
   ```
   TOKEN=(your TOKEN value without parentheses)
   DATABASE_URL=(your DATABASE_URL value without parentheses)
   ```
   
   To define the environment variable values required for the bot functioning

   _**N.B.:** replace the values with the ones you got in the ["Prerequisites" section](https://github.com/matypist/tgroupsindexerbot#prerequisites)_

### Run

2. Run the `pipenv shell` command to activate this project's virtual environment (previously set up in the ["Set up a local running environment" section](https://github.com/matypist/tgroupsindexerbot/blob/main/README.md#set-up-a-local-running-environment)) and load the environment variables

3. Run the `python main.py` command to finally run your bot instance

4. Start a chat with your bot instance on Telegram finding it through the username that you had previously chosen, e.g. via https://telegram.me/(your_bot_instance_username)
