# Sapienza Students Bot

## About the project

[Sapienza Students Bot](https://t.me/SapienzaStudentsBot) was born out of the need, in its time by Sapienza Students, and today by Sapienza Students Network, to promote and make the Telegram groups of students of different courses and their different subjects more easily discoverable from other prospective students

### Current project status

The goal of this first version was to make all the groups previously available in the GO instance available again, but there is still a long way to go, since the main functionality, which consists of the bot's users being able to add the bot to a group and make it indexed by choosing a category (e.g. a degree course) and a sub-category, is still to be implemented. The anti-spam features offered by the previous solution in GO are not a priority at the moment (given also the existence for this purpose of much more established bots such as https://t.me/MissRose_bot and https://t.me/GroupHelpBot), while we would also like to re-introduce the system of assigning a new admin for groups in which the creator has deleted his Telegram account; as well as some useful commands and shortcuts for administrators and users to use within groups.

### The reason behind the choice of Python as programming language

Initially Sapienza Students opted for a solution in the GO programming language (whose code is still available on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/sapienzastudents/antispam-telegram-bot)), recently, with the management of the bot entrusted to [Matypist](https://github.com/matypist) and [Sapienza Students Network](https://github.com/sapienzastudentsnetwork), it was decided to rewrite the bot from scratch in Python. The reason behind this choice is that Python is a mandatory subject in the Computer Science course at Sapienza, mainly through the teaching of "Fondamenti di Programmazione" in the first  semester of the first year of the course, as well as in other Computer Science-related courses available at Sapienza and also most other Italian universities, whereas GO is actually usually only found in teachings at the student's choice. The new aim was therefore the choice of a programming language within the reach of most of the students who will then actually use the bot, so as to facilitate any voluntary collaboration in its development.
